Actually quite decent for a simple setup like this. Nice colors and almost 0 flicker.   
The projector speed adjustment has a nice range and very easy to get close to 0 flicker.  
## Instructons  
Remove the lens by pulling on the focus knob. 
Remove the lens holder screws and remove the lens holder.  
Install the new 3D rpinted holder reusing the same mounting screws.  
Remove the new lens outer cylinder by removing the retaining screws. 
Install the new lens into the lens housing.  
Remove the projector light and mount the led light in its place.  
You will need the new base for the light. Check the mechanical parts folder. 
Install the projeector and teh camera on a suitable stand or a piece of wood dboard.  
Set the camera fps to 30 fps and adjust iris for proper exposure.  
Adjust the distance between the  camera and the projector and at the same time  
adjust the lens distance for best focus and picture size. 
Start recording the video and adjust projector speed for minimum flicker.  
And that is all it takes.
